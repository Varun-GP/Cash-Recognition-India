**This project is a demonstration of Cash Recognition system for Indian currencies.**

**_Problem Statement:       
    _** We live in a world where cognition through visual perception is achieved automatically to understand the surrounding environment. However it is not so easy for people who have moderate or severe vision impairments and they get to interact with environment by experience. Eventhough many of the notes have line textures, embossed patterns, I feel it is necessary to verify and transact with a software tool. This project aims to further aid people to recognize currency notes for India.


**_Methodology:       
    _** We use Machine Learning techniques to recognize a picture.
